Updates on JS Learning


16/11/2023

Today I started learning JS as per your give reference.

How JS works and Execution Contest
	JS works with JS Engine and It is browser specific for ex:- Chrome has V8 Engine.
	JS Engine is useful for Developer while debugging the written code.

	Whenever execute JS 
		1st Create Global Execution Context and simaltaniously creates Call Stack  
		Under GEC having 2 phases (memory and code) 
		
	
	Execution Context is having 2 phases
		a. Memory allocation.
			In this all variables(Initially undefined then value allocated) and functions(Initially entire fun block is allocated) are initially allocated memory.
		b. Code Execution. 
			Once memory allocation done, immediately code execution starts line by line and allocate variable values into the memory phase.


I Understood the JS Execution process today's learnings.
Tomorrow I will create a git repo and upload practice code.
I will share you once the git is created, meanwhile please share your git url.

Please check the above details and let me know if any changes I have to do.
